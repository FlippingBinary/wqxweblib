    " - `fileType` - We're using an XLSX file which is one of the few allowed types. To specify it, we can use the constant `WQXWeb.XLSX`\n",
    " - `worksheetsToImport` - Since we're uploading an XLSX file, we'll need to specify which worksheets to import. This file has the results on sheet 5, so we'll use that. The documentation for the API says this is optional if the import configuration file has a default (which it does) but in practice we need to specify it anyway.\n",
    " - `newOrExistingData` - WQX wants to know if we're submitting new data or updating existing data. Usually, you would specify `WQXWeb.CONTAINS_NEW_ONLY` or `WQXWeb.CONTAINS_EXISTING_ONLY`, but in this example we'll use `WQXWeb.CONTAINS_NEW_OR_EXISTING` so we can run the example multiple times without error.\n",
    " - `uponCompletion` - There is a more advanced way of monitoring the the multiple steps of processing done by WQX Web, but we're going to skip all that by specifying `WQXWeb.EXPORT_IMPORT` which uses WQX Web to export the XML file needed for direct submission to WQX.\n",
    " - `uponCompletionCondition` - WQX Web needs to know what to do if errors or warnings come up while processing your data. We want it to fail if there is even a warning for this example, so we'll use `WQXWeb.EXPORT_IF_NO_WARNING` but you can use the more relaxed `WQXWeb.EXPORT_IF_NO_ERROR` if you want.\n",
